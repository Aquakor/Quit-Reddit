# Quit Reddit
This web app was created in order to minimize the amount of time I spend on reddit.
The point is to gather top posts of the day from given subreddits and display them in a webpage.
This way of browsing reddit reduce the likelihood of scrolling through posts to infinity on reddit.

Web App created with Flask and Praw.
